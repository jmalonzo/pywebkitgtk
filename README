Python WebKit GTK+
----


The PyWebKitGtk project aims to provide Python bindings to the GTK+ port of
WebKit, an open-source web browser engine that powers numerous applications
such as web browsers, email clients, feed readers, web and text editors, and a
whole lot more[1]


Project Goals
----

The project share the same goals with WebKit[2]. The purpose of this binding
is to bring an alternative web engine to Python/GTK+ application developers who
might need a web browser engine for their next application or developers
wishing to have a better browser engine that they can access to using the
Python programming language.


Notes
----

The WebKit GTK+ port is constantly under development and APIs might change. On
this note, this project WILL NOT provide any guarantees to any API stability
let alone engine stability, at least for now. What this project guarantees, is
that (API) changes to the binding will happen and reflect what happens upstream.

And lastly, I would like to encourage everyone to submit useful bugs either to
this project or to the upstream WebKit project[3]. One of my personal
objective for this project is to bring WebKit to more developers and users
alike to improve and guide the development of the upstream WebKit project, let
alone the WebKit GTK+ port.

I hope you find this project this useful as much as I do. 

Happy Hacking!
